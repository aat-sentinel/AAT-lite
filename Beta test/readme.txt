This firmware is same as new release except:

Upon loss of signal for a period of time, the tracker does not set tracker to lost signal position (typically 25 degrees above horizon)
This is to address a very rarely occurring potential bug where tracker may point to the wrong location.  

Settings will be preserved if upgrading from Release 4.0
